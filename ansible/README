Ansible playbooks for Growing Panes
===================================

This sets up a bare Ubuntu 14.04 install to be a Growing Panes video wall
controller. Should work with a server install but using a desktop install
is probably best. Developed with Ansible 1.8.2.

On Server:
  * Install Ubuntu 14.04 server set up with sshd installed
  * It will probably not boot correctly with nvidia hardware installed. To fix, press `e` at the grub menu to edit. Add `nomodeset` to the linux kernel line.
  * Once booted, edit `/etc/default/grub` and add `nomodeset` to the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` line. Run `update-grub` after editing this file.
  * The server should now boot to a login prompt, although the prompt fades out quickly and cannot be recovered. At least you can SSH in :-)
  * `sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon` so you can resolve the `.local` address of the server

On your workstation:
  * Install requirements with `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements`
  * edit `dev` or create new inventory file as appropriate
  * configure system with `ansible-playbook site.yml -i dev`
