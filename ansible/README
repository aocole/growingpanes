Ansible playbooks for Growing Panes
===================================

This sets up a bare Ubuntu 14.04 install to be a Growing Panes video wall
controller. Should work with a server install but using a desktop install
is probably best. Developed with Ansible 1.8.2.

* Install requirements with `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements`
* edit `dev` or create new inventory file as appropriate
* configure system with `ansible-playbook site.yml -i dev`
